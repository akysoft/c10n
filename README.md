Cosmopolitan -- C10N
====================

A Java library, focused on making internationalisation more modular, easier
to evolve and maintain, robust-to-change and IDE-friendly without excess of
external tools. See [the overview][WikiOverview] for some sample code.

*Note:* C10N is still alpha. I am currently working on the first release.
